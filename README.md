# üè° Virtual Smart Home with MQTT

This project creates a **simulated smart home system** using a virtual ESP32 microcontroller within the **Wokwi online simulator**.  
It demonstrates the **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)** protocol with **bidirectional communication** between a microcontroller, a web dashboard, and a mobile app.

---

## üí° Project Highlights

- **Virtual Prototyping**  
  Designed and simulated entirely online using **Wokwi**, eliminating the need for physical hardware.

- **Bidirectional Communication**  
  Uses the **MQTT protocol** to allow a Node-RED dashboard and a mobile app to **remotely control actuators** (LEDs, servo motor) and **monitor sensor data** in real-time.

- **Platform-Independent Control**  
  Integrated with a **mobile MQTT client app**, enabling monitoring and control from a smartphone.

- **Hands-on IoT Experience**  
  Practical exposure to the **complete IoT stack**, from embedded programming to user interface design.

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture

The system is built around a **central MQTT broker** that connects three main clients:

- **ESP32 Microcontroller**
  - Publishes sensor data (e.g., DHT22).
  - Subscribes to control commands (LEDs, servo motor).
  - Acts as the interface to virtual hardware.

- **Node-RED Dashboard**
  - Web-based interface for monitoring and control.
  - Publishes commands via switches and sliders.
  - Subscribes to sensor topics for real-time display.

- **Mobile MQTT Client App**
  - Provides remote access from a smartphone.
  - Performs the same functions as Node-RED.

### üîÑ Communication Flow (Publish-Subscribe Model)

- Example:  
  - **Node-RED Switch** ‚Üí Publishes MQTT message ‚Üí **ESP32** receives and executes action.  
  - **ESP32 Sensor Data** ‚Üí Publishes to topic ‚Üí Subscribed by **Node-RED & Mobile App** ‚Üí Displayed in real-time.
