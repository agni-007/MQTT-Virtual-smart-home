# MQTT-Virtual-smart-home
The project focused on a virtual smart home using the  MQTT protocol. An ESP32 acted as a client, both publishing sensor data and subscribing to commands. A   Node-RED dashboard and a mobile app were used for remote control and monitoring. The system showcased a full, end-to-end IoT solution.
